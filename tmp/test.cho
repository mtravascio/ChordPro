{title: Swing Low Sweet Chariot}

Swing [D]low, sweet [G]chari[D]ot,

Comin’ for to carry me [A#]home.

Swing [D7]low, sweet [G]chari[D]ot,

Comin’ for to [A7]carry me [D]home.

I [D]looked over Jordan, and [G]what did I [D]see,

Comin’ for to carry me [A7]home.

A [D]band of angels [G]comin’ after [D]me,

Comin’ for to [A7]carry me [D]home.
